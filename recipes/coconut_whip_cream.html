        <ul>
            <li>Chill you coconut milk can before making the whip</li>
            <li>Colder equipment makes for fluffier more stable whip cream. Chill the bowl and whisk attachment of your mixer in the freezer for 10 minutes before whipping.</li>
            <li>For best results chill the final product in the fridge for at least 3 hours or overnight.</li>

                <li>Let the whip firm up in the fridge for 3 hours or overnight.</li>
